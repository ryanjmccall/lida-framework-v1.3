/**
 * This is the base interface for all task process in the LIDA framework. All
 * parts of processes in the LIDA Framework have to implement this interface. A
 * FrameworkTask is intended as a small fraction of a process. For example a
 * {@link Codelet} or a Feature detector are examples of FrameworkTask. However,
 * if the process includes a loop, one run of the FrameworkTask represents only
 * one iteration of the loop.
 * 
 * A {@link TaskSpawner} can send FrameworkTasks to the {@link TaskManager} for
 * execution. A {@link TaskSpawner} receives the task each time it finishes
 * running, so the TaskSpawner can decide if this particular task must run again
 * or not. This is based on the status of the FrameworkTask. The FrameworkTask
 * should set its status during it execution. Implementations of this interface
 * should call the task's TaskSpawner method,
 * {@link TaskSpawner#receiveFinishedTask(FrameworkTask)}, to handle the
 * finished task at the end of the 'call' method.
 * 
 * @see FrameworkTaskImpl Most tasks can extend from this instead of
 *      implementing this interface from scratch.
